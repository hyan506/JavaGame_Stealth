You will need to install Java SDK and javafx to run this game.

You can easily import the whole project into eclipse and run.
Or you might have your other ways to launch the game.
-------------------------------------------------------
This project is supposed to be done by group in 2.
I ended up doing 99% of the project. My teammate added audio in the last minite and his code is messy.
Myself is not satisfied with the overall game quality because i did not have enough time to fully develop it.
Please ignore the multiplayer part, it is not fully done. I added that just to get a few more marks.
Sorry, there is no AI in this game, because I could not finish everything by myself.
